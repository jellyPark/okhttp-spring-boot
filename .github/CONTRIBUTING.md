## Branching

When starting to work on a pull request make sure to start your work on the correct branch.
This repository uses the same branching model as _Spring Boot_ and the _Spring Framework_.

The `master` branch always contains the latest _bleeding edge_ code, while the older versions live in their own branches.

__For example:__ If you wan't to fix a bug in Version `1.x.y`, make sure to start your work on the `1.x` branch
and not on the `master` branch. When opening the pull request make also sure, to set `1.x` as _base_.
